"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability in websites that allows an "
"attacker to inject malicious code into the page you are visiting. This "
"can cause the page to behave differently than usual, such as displaying "
"strange messages or stealing your data, like passwords or login "
"information. This type of attack exploits the fact that the website does "
"not properly validate what a user can input or click on."
