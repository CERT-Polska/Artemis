Welcome to Artemis documentation!
=================================

A modular web reconnaisance tool and vulnerability scanner based on Karton
(https://github.com/CERT-Polska/karton).

**Artemis is experimental software, under active development - use at your own risk.**

Artemis is built with scalability in mind -- different scanners are separate microservices
and can be scaled independently if such a need arises.
