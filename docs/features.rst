Features
========

Artemis includes:

 - subdomain scan using ``crt.sh`` and ``gau`` (https://github.com/lc/gau),
 - Shodan integration,
 - brute-forcing of interesting paths (e.g. ``.env``),
 - brute-forcing of easy WordPress/MySQL/PostgreSQL/FTP passwords,
 - email configuration verification (misconfigured SPF/DMARC, open relays),
 - Wordpress/Joomla version check,
 - a check for VCS folders (e.g. ``.git``),
 - a check for enabled directory index,
 - port scanning,
 - easy extensibility via plug-and-play modules.

Rate limiting
-------------

Artemis is build in such a way that no particular host can be overloaded with requests.
This is disabled by default. To enable that behavior, configure the following variables:

 - set ``LOCK_SCANNED_TARGETS`` to ``True`` to enable locking,
 - ``SECONDS_PER_REQUEST_FOR_ONE_IP`` - e.g. when set to 2, Artemis will strive to make no more than
   one HTTP/MySQL connect/... request per two seconds for any IP,
 - ``SCANNING_PACKETS_PER_SECOND_PER_IP`` - e.g. when set to 100, Artemis will strive to send no more than
   100 port scanning packets per seconds to any IP.

The IP lock is global - Artemis strives to allow at most one module to communicate with a given IP.
Due to the way this behavior is implemented, we cannot guarantee that a host will never receive more than X
requests per second.

REST API
--------

REST API documentation is auto-generated by the FastAPI framework in the form of
Swagger and is available at your Artemis instance under ``/docs`` URL.
