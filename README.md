## Development

### Tests
To run the tests, use:

```
./scripts/test
```

### Code formatting
Artemis uses `pre-commit` to run linters and format the code.
`pre-commit` is executed on CI to verify that the code is formatted properly.

To run it locally, use:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To setup `pre-commit` so that it runs before each commit, use:

```
pre-commit install
```

### Building the docs

To build the documentation, use:

```
cd docs
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
```

## How do I write my own module?

Please refer to [the documentation](https://artemis-scanner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/writing-a-module.html).
