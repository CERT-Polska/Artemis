                To decrease the probability of an attack (caused by an attacker using a leaked password,
                by one of the accounts having a weak password, or by vulnerabilities in the service), we
                recommend to have as few such publicly accessible services as possible.

                    A password leak may be caused by an accidentally exposed configuration file such as a backup of
                    <tt>/wp-config.php</tt> or by a local file inclusion vulnerability. Such mistakes are
                    frequent, and lack of publicly exposed database management panels makes it significantly
                    harder to perform an attack.
