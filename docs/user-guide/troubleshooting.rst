Troubleshooting
===============

Startup issues related to port 5000
-----------------------------------
On some configurations (e.g. MacOS using AirPlay Receiver) port 5000 is already used, which will cause Artemis startup issues.
To change that, replace ``ports: ["5000:5000"]`` with e.g. ``ports: ["7500:5000"]`` in ``docker-compose.yaml``.

Windows build issues
--------------------
If you are using Windows and you see the following message during container build:

.. code-block::

    ------
    RUN cd /nuclei && git apply nuclei-rate-limiting.patch  && cd v2/cmd/nuclei && go build && GOBIN=/usr/local/bin/ go install:
    #85 2.234 error: corrupt patch at line 7

this may mean that during clone you configured Git to change newlines from Linux (``\n``) to Windows (``\r\n``). Changing
this setting will fix the problem.

MongoDB startup issues
----------------------

MongoDB since version 5 requires AVX support from the CPU. Certain virtualized environments don't support AVX instructions. **We strongly
recommend contacting your cloud provider to enable AVX support for the virtual machine**, but if it's not possible, a workaround for this
is to pin MongoDB to version 4 in ``docker-compose.yaml``. Below are logs which you might see when this is the case:

.. code-block::

    artemis-backend-1  |   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pymongo/topology.py", line 238, in _select_servers_loop
    artemis-backend-1  |     raise ServerSelectionTimeoutError(

Shodan module startup issues
----------------------------

If you see the following error in the logs:

.. code-block::

    artemis-shodan-vulns-1  |   File "/opt/artemis/modules/shodan_vulns.py", line 97, in <module>
    artemis-shodan-vulns-1  |     raise Exception("Shodan API key is required")
    artemis-shodan-vulns-1  | Exception: Shodan API key is required

That means the Shodan module wasn't able to start because an API key was not configured.
To fix this, provide the ``SHODAN_API_KEY`` configuration variable, see :doc:`configuration`.
