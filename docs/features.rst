Rate limiting
-------------
Artemis is build in such a way that no particular host is overloaded with requests.
To enable that behavior, configure the following two variables:

 - ``SECONDS_PER_REQUEST_FOR_ONE_IP`` - e.g. when set to 2, Artemis will strive to make no more than
   one HTTP/MySQL connect/... request per two seconds for any host,
 - ``SCANNING_PACKETS_PER_SECOND_PER_IP`` - e.g. when set to 100, Artemis will strive to send no more than
   100 port scanning packets per seconds to any host.

Due to the way this behavior is implemented, we cannot guarantee that a host will never receive more than X
requests per second.

REST API
--------

REST API documentation is auto-generated by the FastAPI framework in the form of
Swagger and is available at your Artemis instance under ``/docs`` URL.
