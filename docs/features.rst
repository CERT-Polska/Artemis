Features
========

Artemis includes:

 - subdomain scan using ``crt.sh`` and ``gau`` (https://github.com/lc/gau),
 - Shodan integration (to use it, you will need to provide the ``SHODAN_API_KEY``
   configuration variable, see :doc:`user-guide/configuration`),
 - brute-forcing of interesting paths (e.g. ``.env``),
 - brute-forcing of easy WordPress/MySQL/PostgreSQL/FTP passwords,
 - email configuration verification (misconfigured SPF/DMARC, open relays),
 - Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal/WordPress plugin version check,
 - a check for VCS folders (e.g. ``.git``),
 - a check for enabled directory index,
 - port scanning,
 - metrics export for Prometheus (including data such as number of processed or crashed tasks): http://127.0.0.1:5000/metrics
 - easy extensibility via plug-and-play modules,
 - easy :doc:`integration of a new tool<user-guide/writing-a-module>`,
 - HTTP API to facillitate integration with other tools.

Artemis is able to **automatically generate reports containing findings description** (to do that,
please refer to :ref:`generating-reports`).

Besides, the additional modules repository (https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis-modules-extra/) includes:

 - SQL injection check,
 - subdomain takeover check,
 - SSL configuration check.

Rate limiting
-------------

Artemis is build in such a way that no particular host can be overloaded with requests.
This is disabled by default. To enable that behavior, configure the following variables:

 - set ``LOCK_SCANNED_TARGETS`` to ``True`` to enable locking,
 - ``SECONDS_PER_REQUEST`` - e.g. when set to 2, Artemis will strive to make no more than
   one HTTP/MySQL connect/... request per two seconds for any IP,
 - ``SCANNING_PACKETS_PER_SECOND`` - e.g. when set to 100, Artemis will strive to send no more than
   100 port scanning packets per seconds to any IP.

The IP lock is global - Artemis strives to allow at most one module to communicate with a given IP.
Due to the way this behavior is implemented, we cannot guarantee that a host will never receive more than X
requests per second.

REST API
--------

REST API documentation is auto-generated by the FastAPI framework in the form of
Swagger and is available at your Artemis instance under ``/docs`` URL.
